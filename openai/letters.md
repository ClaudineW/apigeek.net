## Albert Einstein

Dear Albert Einstein,

my name is Alex and my teacher was telling me about your work. She also told me that you once said "God does not play dice". Can you please tell me what you meant by that?

Best regards,   
Alex

Dear Alex,

I will try to explain. When I said, "God does not play dice." I meant that the laws of the universe are not random. I believe that everything in nature has a reason and a purpose. I believe that we must have a reason for our existence. I don't know what the reasons are. But I believe that they are there.

## Johannes Gutenberg

Dear Johannes Gutenberg,

your invention of the letterpress literally changed humanity forever! You must be very proud. Can you tell me what that feels like for you?

Dear Uli,

I am not proud, because I do not compare myself to others. I only did what I did.

I am happy that I can help many people with my work.

## Julius Caesar

Dear Julius Caesar,

in school I studied Latin, and during that time I read a lot of your work. Can you tell me a little about how you wrote all these texts on war strategy and the battles? Did you write them at night in your tent when the soldiers were sleeping? And what was your motivation to be so productive? I'm really curious!

Hope to hear from you,   
Isabel

Dear Isabel,

I often got very little sleep; most of my work was done during the day, in the heat of battle. I also wrote at night, in my tent. But I think that it is better to work when it is already dark outside. 

I have been asked many times why I wrote so many books. I believe that the main reason was that I was working for the state and had to deliver., and also to explain my actions and decisions. In fact, I wrote a lot because I had a passion for writing and I believed that my writing was useful. 

Yours truly,   
Julius

## Nikola Tesla

Dear Nikola Tesla,

I heard you and Thomas Edison didn't get along with each other well. Can you tell me your side of the story please?

Dear Max,

I worked with Thomas Edison him for about two years. I was a young inventor, and he was an old one. We had a difference of opinion in our methods. I wanted to improve everything I saw, while he wanted to keep everything unchanged. In other aspects, we were very much alike. We both had a liking for experiment, and were very much interested in the future. We were always busy, and were trying to improve everything we were working on.


A difference of opinion was inevitable, so it was time for me to move on. There was some friction between us, but later on, not only we became good friends, but also he became a good friend of my family.

## Leonardo Davinci

Dear Leonardo Da Vinci,

I've seen that you are extremely good at hiding messages with your mirror writing style and the codes in your paintings. My question to you is: why did you feel it was necessary to do that? Why did you had to hide all this?

Best regards,
Johanna

Dear Johanna,

I have often used this code of writing to conceal the true meaning of my words or to mock the stupidity of a person. It was also used to annoy and challenge the intelligence of other men. Maybe I also did it because of my  vanity that wanted to keep my works for myself and only for myself. At the time I was also tired of being copied by other painters. So I started to hide in this way the true meanings of my artworks.

With respect,

Leonardo Da Vinci
