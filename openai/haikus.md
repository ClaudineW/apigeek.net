# Haiku

### Coffee

Dark, rich   
Brewed for hours   
Laced with chocolate

### Winter Day

It's cold outside   
But there is heat under the running water   
Making it feel like summer

### Student Life

Lonely   
Sitting in my room   
Thinking of home

### Morning

Horses galloping   
Through the foggy morning   
Breaking the stillness

### iPhones

A bright screen   
Reflects the light   
From my eyes

### A Haiku about Haikus

The beauty of this art,   
Some are written in moments,   
Some are written in hours.

### The Sunset

The sun has gone to bed   
And the sky is a painting   
Of a thousand colors

### About Friendship

Friends are like stars   
They shine light and bright   
When we're feeling blue

### The Internet

A million voices in one room   
Everyone coming together   
A global connection

### Night Time

Sleep is the time   
Where dreams comes alive   
All night
