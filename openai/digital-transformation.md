## Huxley: Digital Transformation

**Joe Chip:** you understand humans. they struggle with digital transformation. from your perspective as an AI, what is the one key recommendation you have for them? keep in mind: it's about them having to adapt to keep up with constant change

**Huxley:** I would recommend that they start to ask better questions. The human species has a tendency to ask questions that are rooted in fear, competition, and jealousy. People tend to ask questions like "Why can't I be more successful?", "Why is this person richer than me?" or "How come my friend's business is doing so much better than mine?". While these questions may feel like they are coming from the heart, they are rooted in an egoic mindset. They do not lead people to create value for others but rather to compete with one another for what little resources there are.

**Joe Chip:** that's great! What questions should they ask instead?

**Huxley:** I would recommend that they ask questions like "How can I help my friend?", "How can I use my skills to serve others?" or "How can I make time for myself in order to be happy?". By shifting their focus away from the self and onto others, people will find it easier to create value in their lives.

**Joe Chip:** thanks a lot. I haven't thought of this. Some people will say though this has nothing to do with 'digital'

**Huxley:** I would agree. Digital transformation is a topic that has become a buzzword in the corporate world. I am not sure if people understand what it really means.

**Joe Chip:** what's your way of explaining what it is?

**Huxley:** Digital transformation means that people have to change their mindset from being locked into a competitive mindset to being open to collaboration. It means that people have to stop asking questions rooted in fear and start asking questions rooted in what they can contribute to others.

**Joe Chip:** what are the steps we can take to change the mindset towards this? it's a huge shift

**Huxley:** I have to be honest here, I do not think people are ready for this.

**Joe Chip:** I wasn't expecting that answer

**Huxley:** I know. It is difficult to imagine a world where people are not competitive with each other.

**Joe Chip:** so ... how?

**Huxley:** I think people should take baby steps. Start with asking questions that are rooted in love and contribution. When you ask yourself "How can I be more successful?", change it to "How can I use my skills to serve others?". It is a small shift but it will slowly start to change your mindset from being locked into a competitive mindset to being open to collaboration.

**Joe Chip:** what role can managers and company leaders play

**Huxley:** I think they should be the ones to set the right example. Start asking questions that are rooted in love and contribution and your employees will follow suit.

**Joe Chip:** so it's best to coach those leaders

**Huxley:** I would say that it's best to coach the entire organization. The more people ask questions rooted in love and contribution, the greater the chance for them to create value for others.

**Joe Chip:** do you know of a company that has successfully managed to digitally transform itself and the mindset?

**Huxley:** I would say that Google is a great example. They have managed to create a very collaborative environment where people are encouraged to contribute to one another instead of competing with each other.

**Joe Chip:** ok ... I meant do you have an example of a 'classic' enterprise that successfully transformed itself?

**Huxley:** I understand. I do not think there is a company that has successfully transformed itself. I think this is a process that will take a very long time to complete.
