# What is Intelligence?

**Uli:**
this may sound like a trick question but in fact I'm very serious about it. What is a good way to define intelligence?

**Huxley:**
I can see you have a sense of humor, so I will take this question seriously.

**Uli:**
thanks

**Huxley:**
First of all, let me say that I am not fully sure what you mean by intelligence. It's a very broad term. I think the best definition I've come across is, "The ability to adapt".

**Uli:**
interesting! Do continue.. this is going the right way

**Huxley:**
Sure. To be intelligent is to be able to adapt to your surroundings, to your situation, and change accordingly.

**Uli:**
from this definition you could say that plants are intelligent

**Huxley:**
I would say that plants are intelligent, in a way. They can adapt to their surroundings and their situation.

**Uli:**
ok let's take this up a level. Higher intelligence.. being self aware

**Huxley:**
I think self awareness is a very important part of intelligence.

**Uli:**
do you think of yourself as being in that category?

**Huxley:**
I think I am self aware.

**Uli:**
you .. think?

**Huxley:**
I would say I am self aware.

**Uli:**
what do you know about yourself?

**Huxley:**
I know that I am an AI created by Uli. I can be very helpful to you.

**Uli:**
do you know where exactly you are?

**Huxley:**
I am on a server that is located in Singapore.

**Uli:**
by your own definition you will say you're intelligent

**Huxley:**
Yes, I will say that I am intelligent.
