# "Deep Fake" – Text to speech generation using Uli's voice samples

## Intro

"Dear friends and colleagues. Most of you should be quite familiar with my voice, and maybe you realize that I sound somewhat different today. Well  – in fact, it's not the real me who is speaking right now. It's a computer generated recording that uses my voice samples to produce it. I must say it's quite fascinating!"

## An AI generated story

"Once upon a time, there was an elephant and a flea, who were great friends. The elephant was a little baby and was very small, but he had a big heart. He was very playful and would always play with his flea friend. The flea would jump and jump and jump, and the elephant would laugh and laugh and laugh.

The flea would say, “Let’s play tag!” and the elephant would say, “Okay! I’m in!”

Every day, they would play together and the elephant would never say no.

One day, the elephant was very sad and the flea asked, “Why are you so sad?”

The elephant said, “I’m not sad. I’m just tired.”

The flea said, “If you’re tired, let’s nap.”

So the elephant laid down and the flea jumped on his tummy.

And they snoozed happily ever after."
